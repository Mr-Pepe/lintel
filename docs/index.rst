pydoclint's documentation
==========================

**pydoclint** is a static analysis tool for checking compliance with Python
docstring conventions.

**pydoclint** supports most of
`PEP 257 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_ out of the box, but it
should not be considered a reference implementation.

**pydoclint** supports Python 3.8 through 3.11.

Although pydoclint is tries to be compatible with Python 3.6, it is not tested.
